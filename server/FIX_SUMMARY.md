# Fix Summary: _is_public_path Edge Case Handling

## Problem Description

The `_is_public_path` method in `AuthenticationMiddleware` had edge cases where trailing slashes and prefix matching weren't handled correctly. Specifically:

1. **Trailing slash inconsistency**: Paths like `/docs/` might not match `/docs` consistently
2. **Incorrect prefix matching**: Paths like `/redocument` would incorrectly match the `/redoc` prefix
3. **Boundary issues**: The original logic used simple `startswith()` which didn't respect word boundaries

## Root Cause

The original implementation:
```python
def _is_public_path(self, path: str) -> bool:
    # Check exact matches
    if path in self.public_paths:
        return True
    
    # Check path without trailing slash for flexibility
    path_no_slash = path.rstrip('/')
    if path_no_slash in self.public_paths:
        return True
    
    # Check prefixes for documentation paths - PROBLEMATIC!
    public_prefixes = ["/docs", "/redoc", "/static"]
    return any(path.startswith(prefix) for prefix in public_prefixes)
```

The issue was in the prefix checking logic - `path.startswith(prefix)` would match:
- `/redocument` against `/redoc` ❌ (incorrect)
- `/documents` against `/docs` ❌ (incorrect, though this specific case didn't occur)
- `/stationary` against `/static` ❌ (incorrect, though this specific case didn't occur)

## Solution

The fixed implementation:
```python
def _is_public_path(self, path: str) -> bool:
    # Normalize path by stripping trailing slash (except for root)
    normalized_path = path.rstrip('/') if path != '/' else path
    
    # Check exact matches
    if normalized_path in self.public_paths:
        return True
    
    # Check path with trailing slash for flexibility (in case public_paths contains trailing slashes)
    if path != normalized_path and path in self.public_paths:
        return True
    
    # Check prefixes for documentation paths
    # We need to ensure the prefix match is a proper directory boundary
    public_prefixes = ["/docs", "/redoc", "/static"]
    for prefix in public_prefixes:
        # Path starts with prefix AND either:
        # 1. Path is exactly the prefix
        # 2. Path starts with prefix followed by '/' (proper directory boundary)
        if normalized_path == prefix or normalized_path.startswith(prefix + "/"):
            return True
    
    return False
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Path normalization**: Consistently handle trailing slashes by normalizing paths
2. **Proper boundary checking**: Use `prefix + "/"` to ensure we match directory boundaries
3. **Exact prefix matching**: Also allow exact matches for the prefixes themselves
4. **Root path handling**: Special case for root path `/` to preserve its trailing slash

## Test Cases Added

### Trailing Slash Edge Cases
- `/docs/` should match `/docs` ✅
- `/redoc/` should match `/redoc` ✅  
- `/static/` should match `/static` ✅
- Multiple slashes like `/docs//` should work ✅

### Boundary Cases (The Main Bug Fix)
- `/redocument` should NOT match `/redoc` ✅
- `/documents` should NOT match `/docs` ✅
- `/stationary` should NOT match `/static` ✅
- `/documentation` should NOT match `/docs` ✅
- `/redistribute` should NOT match `/redoc` ✅
- `/statistics` should NOT match `/static` ✅

### Valid Prefix Matches (Should Still Work)
- `/docs/swagger` should match `/docs` ✅
- `/redoc/assets` should match `/redoc` ✅
- `/static/css/style.css` should match `/static` ✅

## Files Changed

1. **bruno_ai_server/middleware/auth_middleware.py**: Updated `_is_public_path` method
2. **tests/test_auth_middleware.py**: Added comprehensive edge case tests:
   - `test_public_path_trailing_slash_edge_cases`
   - `test_public_path_boundary_cases`

## Verification

All tests pass:
- Original functionality maintained
- Edge cases properly handled
- No false positives in security matching
- Trailing slash handling consistent

The fix ensures that public path detection is both secure (no false positives) and robust (handles trailing slashes correctly).
