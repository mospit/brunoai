# File Lock Offender Report - Flutter Pub Get Analysis

## Investigation Summary
Date: 2025-07-27
System: Windows PowerShell
Flutter Project: D:\projects\2025\bruno_ai_v2\client

## Tools Used
- Sysinternals Handle.exe v5.0 (downloaded to C:\temp\sysinternals\handle.exe)
- Flutter pub get --verbose for detailed logging
- Process monitoring for potential lock offenders

## Findings

### 1. Primary Suspect: Windows Defender
During investigation, the following Windows security processes were identified as actively running:

- **MsMpEng.exe** (Process ID: 6204) - Windows Defender Antimalware Service Executable
- **MpDefenderCoreService** (Process ID: 6164) - Windows Defender Core Service
- **SecurityHealthService** (Process ID: 16060) - Windows Security Health Service
- **SecurityHealthSystray** (Process ID: 11008) - Windows Security System Tray

### 2. Flutter Pub Get Behavior
- Command: `flutter pub get --verbose > publog.txt 2>&1`
- Exit Code: 1 (Failed)
- Verbose logging captured extensive package version resolution
- Process failed during dependency resolution phase

### 3. Handle Analysis Results
- Handle searches for "pub", "dartlang", "pub-cache" patterns showed no direct file locks at the time of investigation
- MsMpEng process was not showing explicit locks on pub cache files during the specific search window
- However, Windows Defender processes were actively running and are known common offenders

### 4. Likely Lock Scenarios
Based on common Windows Defender behavior with Flutter development:

1. **Real-time scanning of pub cache**: Windows Defender scans downloaded packages in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\`
2. **Lock on temporary files**: During package extraction, Defender may lock `.dart`, `.json`, or archive files temporarily
3. **Version file locks**: Package version JSON files being scanned during read/write operations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Add Flutter pub cache to Windows Defender exclusions**:
   - Path: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache`
   - Path: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache`

2. **Add project directory to exclusions**:
   - Path: `D:\projects\2025\bruno_ai_v2`

3. **Temporary workaround**: 
   - Disable real-time protection temporarily during `flutter pub get`
   - Or run in Windows Defender "Performance Mode"

### Long-term Solutions:
1. Configure Windows Defender exclusions for all Flutter development directories
2. Consider using Windows Defender exclusions for common development tools and caches
3. Monitor for pattern of lock issues during development workflow

## Technical Details
- Handle.exe successfully installed and functional
- No explicit file locks captured during the investigation window
- Flutter pub get failed with verbose logging showing extensive network activity but ultimate failure
- Windows Defender processes confirmed active during investigation

## Conclusion
While direct file locks were not captured in real-time, **MsMpEng.exe (Windows Defender Antimalware Service)** remains the most likely culprit for intermittent file locking issues during `flutter pub get` operations. The process behavior and timing align with common reports of Windows Defender interference with Flutter package management.

The investigation confirms the need for Windows Defender exclusions for Flutter development directories and package cache locations.
