# Windows Defender Antivirus Exclusions

This document tracks the Windows Defender exclusions added for optimal Dart & Flutter development performance.

## Background
Windows Defender can significantly slow down Dart & Flutter development by scanning:
- Package cache directories
- Build outputs  
- SDK files
- Project files during compilation

Adding exclusions prevents unnecessary scanning and improves build performance.

## Added Exclusions

**Exclusion Paths Added:**

1. **Pub Cache Directory**
   - Path: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache`
   - Purpose: Dart/Flutter package cache - frequently accessed during builds
