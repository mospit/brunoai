# Task ID: 3
# Title: Voice Assistant Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate voice assistant capabilities with STT and TTS for hands-free interaction
# Details:
Integrate Mistral Voxtral API for speech-to-text with 95%+ accuracy on food terms. Implement TTS provider for natural-sounding responses. Support English with regional accents, include noise cancellation for kitchen environments, and provide text fallback when voice fails.

# Test Strategy:
Test voice recognition accuracy with food terms, verify TTS responses sound natural, validate noise cancellation works in kitchen environments

# Subtasks:
## 1. Mistral Voxtral STT API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Mistral Voxtral API for speech-to-text (STT) to enable accurate voice transcription, focusing on food-related vocabulary.
### Details:
Set up authentication, handle audio input (file/stream), and process API responses for real-time transcription. Ensure 95%+ accuracy on food terms.

## 2. TTS Provider Evaluation and Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and integrate a text-to-speech (TTS) provider that delivers natural-sounding responses with support for English regional accents.
### Details:
Compare leading TTS providers for voice quality, latency, and accent support. Integrate the selected provider into the voice assistant workflow.

## 3. Voice UX Flow Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the user experience flow for hands-free voice interactions, including prompts, confirmations, and error handling.
### Details:
Map out conversational states, fallback scenarios, and transitions between voice and text modes. Ensure accessibility and intuitive navigation.

## 4. Noise Cancellation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement noise cancellation to improve voice recognition accuracy in kitchen environments.
### Details:
Integrate or configure noise suppression algorithms compatible with the STT pipeline. Optimize for typical kitchen background sounds.

## 5. Accuracy Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive testing suite to evaluate STT and TTS accuracy, especially for food terms and regional accents.
### Details:
Automate tests with diverse audio samples, track error rates, and generate reports for continuous improvement.

## 6. Flutter Voice Packages Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Integrate Flutter-compatible voice packages to bridge native STT and TTS capabilities with the appâ€™s UI.
### Details:
Select and configure Flutter plugins for audio capture, playback, and real-time streaming to backend APIs.

## 7. Voice Command Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3, 3.6
### Description: Implement logic to route recognized voice commands to appropriate app functions and handle ambiguous input.
### Details:
Define command patterns, fallback intents, and error correction strategies. Ensure extensibility for future commands.

## 8. Text Fallback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.7
### Description: Develop a fallback mechanism that prompts users to switch to text input when voice recognition fails or is unavailable.
### Details:
Detect repeated STT failures or user frustration, then offer a seamless transition to manual text entry.
