# Task ID: 9
# Title: Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing strategy and quality assurance
# Details:
Develop unit tests with 80% code coverage, integration tests for API endpoints and third-party services, performance testing for 1,000 concurrent users, accessibility testing for WCAG compliance, voice testing for STT/TTS accuracy, memory testing for Mem0 recall, and multi-agent coordination testing. Include beta testing with 50 families over 4 weeks.

# Test Strategy:
Achieve target metrics: zero critical bugs, app crash rate <0.1%, voice accuracy >90%, TTS naturalness >4.0/5.0, memory recall >95%, user satisfaction >4.0/5.0

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Testing Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and maintain unit tests to achieve at least 80% code coverage across all critical modules.
### Details:
Identify core components and write automated unit tests using the chosen testing framework. Ensure tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation.

## 2. Integration Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement integration tests for API endpoints and third-party service interactions.
### Details:
Set up an integration testing environment that simulates real-world API and service interactions. Automate tests to validate data flow and error handling between system components.

## 3. Voice Accuracy Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test and validate speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities for accuracy and naturalness.
### Details:
Develop test cases for various voice commands and responses. Measure STT accuracy and TTS naturalness using predefined benchmarks and user feedback.

## 4. Memory Testing for Mem0 Recall [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess and validate the Mem0 memory module for accurate recall and retention of user data.
### Details:
Create test scenarios to evaluate memory recall under different usage patterns and data loads. Simulate edge cases and stress conditions.

## 5. Accessibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure application compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
### Details:
Conduct automated and manual accessibility audits, including screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and keyboard navigation.

## 6. Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate system performance under load, targeting 1,000 concurrent users.
### Details:
Design and execute load and stress tests to measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Identify and address bottlenecks.

## 7. User Acceptance and Beta Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Coordinate and execute beta testing with 50 families over a 4-week period to gather real-world feedback.
### Details:
Recruit participants, distribute test builds, collect feedback, and track issues. Analyze user satisfaction and identify usability improvements.

## 8. End-to-End Testing Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and automate comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios covering multi-agent coordination and core user journeys.
### Details:
Map out critical workflows, including multi-agent interactions, and automate scenario execution to validate system behavior from start to finish.
