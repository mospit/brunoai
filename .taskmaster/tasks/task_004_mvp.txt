# Task ID: 4
# Title: Household Sharing and Collaboration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement household sharing functionality for collaborative pantry and shopping list management
# Details:
Create household invitation system via 6-digit codes, implement real-time sync of pantry changes using FastAPI WebSockets, develop conflict resolution for simultaneous edits, and establish role-based permissions (admin/member).

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-user scenarios with simultaneous edits, verify real-time sync works correctly, validate permission system prevents unauthorized actions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Household Data Model Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a robust data model to represent households, members, roles, and their relationships for collaborative pantry and shopping list management.
### Details:
Define entities such as Household, User, Membership, Role, Pantry, and ShoppingList. Establish relationships (e.g., many-to-many between users and households, role assignments, shared resources). Ensure scalability for multiple households per user and vice versa.

## 2. Invite Code Generation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop a secure system for generating, distributing, and validating 6-digit household invitation codes.
### Details:
Implement unique, time-limited codes linked to specific households. Handle code expiration, collision avoidance, and secure code redemption workflows.

## 3. WebSocket Real-Time Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement real-time synchronization of pantry and shopping list changes across all household members using FastAPI WebSockets.
### Details:
Establish WebSocket endpoints for household channels. Ensure updates propagate instantly to all connected clients and handle reconnection logic.

## 4. Conflict Resolution Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Design and implement logic to resolve conflicts arising from simultaneous edits to shared pantry or shopping lists.
### Details:
Define conflict scenarios (e.g., item edits, deletions, additions), select resolution strategies (last-write-wins, merge, or user prompts), and ensure data consistency.

## 5. Role-Based Permissions System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Establish a permissions framework supporting admin and member roles with granular access controls for household actions.
### Details:
Define role capabilities (e.g., invite, remove, edit, view), enforce permissions at API and UI levels, and support future role expansion.

## 6. Member Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.5
### Description: Develop features for managing household membership, including inviting, removing, and updating member roles.
### Details:
Implement member listing, role assignment changes, and removal workflows. Ensure audit trails for membership changes.

## 7. Shared Pantry State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement centralized management of the shared pantry state, ensuring consistency and integrity across all household members.
### Details:
Maintain a single source of truth for pantry data, handle concurrent updates, and provide versioning or change history if needed.

## 8. Collaborative Shopping List Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.7
### Description: Enable collaborative creation, editing, and completion of shopping lists within a household context.
### Details:
Allow multiple members to add, edit, and check off items in real time. Support notifications for list changes and completion.
