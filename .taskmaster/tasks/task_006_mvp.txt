# Task ID: 6
# Title: Multi-Agent System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement multi-agent system architecture using CrewAI framework
# Details:
Set up CrewAI framework for multi-agent coordination. Implement Orchestrator Agent (central coordinator with GPT-4.1), Pantry Agent (inventory management with GPT-4.1-mini), Meal Agent (recipe suggestions with GPT-4.1), Shopping Agent (list generation), Voice Agent (STT/TTS processing), and Collaboration Agent (real-time sync). Include RouteLLM for cost-optimized model routing and Mem0 for memory layer.

# Test Strategy:
Test agent coordination and communication, verify RouteLLM routing works correctly, validate Mem0 memory persistence and recall

# Subtasks:
## 1. AutoGen Agent Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure the AutoGen agent framework within the CrewAI environment to enable dynamic agent creation and management.
### Details:
Install required dependencies, set up project structure, and ensure compatibility between AutoGen and CrewAI for seamless agent instantiation and lifecycle management.

## 2. RouteLLM Cost-Optimized Routing Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Integrate RouteLLM to enable cost-optimized routing of model requests across agents based on workload and pricing.
### Details:
Configure RouteLLM within the CrewAI framework, define routing policies, and connect agents to RouteLLM for dynamic model selection and cost control.

## 3. Mem0 Memory Layer Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Integrate the Mem0 memory layer to provide persistent, context-aware memory for all agents in the system.
### Details:
Set up Mem0, connect it to each agent, and configure memory scopes (short-term, long-term, entity) for context retention and recall.

## 4. Pantry Agent Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Develop the Pantry Agent for inventory management using GPT-4.1-mini, including item tracking and update logic.
### Details:
Implement inventory data models, CRUD operations, and integrate Mem0 for stateful tracking. Ensure agent can communicate updates to other agents.

## 5. Meal Agent Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Develop the Meal Agent for recipe suggestion and meal planning using GPT-4.1, leveraging pantry data and user preferences.
### Details:
Implement recipe generation logic, integrate with Pantry Agent for ingredient availability, and use Mem0 for user preference recall.

## 6. Shopping Agent Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Develop the Shopping Agent to generate shopping lists based on meal plans and pantry inventory.
### Details:
Implement logic to compare pantry inventory with meal requirements, generate optimized shopping lists, and prepare data for external integrations.

## 7. Agent Coordination Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Implement the coordination logic for orchestrating agent interactions, task delegation, and real-time synchronization using CrewAIâ€™s orchestration features.
### Details:
Define agent roles, communication protocols, and task flows. Integrate RouteLLM for routing and Mem0 for shared context. Ensure robust error handling and conflict resolution.
