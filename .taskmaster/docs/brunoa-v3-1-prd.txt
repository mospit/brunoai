5. Technical Architecture  
5.1 Technology Stack (Simplified for Feasibility)  
Frontend: Flutter for cross-platform mobile development  

Backend: Python with FastAPI, PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM  

AI/ML: CrewAI for cutting-edge multi-agent system orchestration (selected as top 2025 framework for coordinating autonomous agents in collaborative workflows; supports sequential, hierarchical, and bi-directional coordination); RouteLLM for cost-optimized LLM routing (e.g., routing simple queries to GPT-4.1-mini and complex ones to GPT-4.1, using 'mf' router with calibrated thresholds); Mem0 for universal memory layer (storing user preferences, session states, and agent history for personalized interactions); OpenAI GPT-4.1 (strong model) and GPT-4.1-mini (weak model) for agent intelligence and meal suggestions  

Voice: Mistral's Voxtral API for STT (speech-to-text) with multilingual support and 95%+ accuracy on food terms; TTS (text-to-speech) provider TBD for speak feature to enable Bruno to verbally respond; integrated via Flutter packages like speech_to_text and flutter_tts  

Real-time: FastAPI WebSockets for household synchronization  

Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions  

Third-Party Integrations: Instacart Developer Platform API for grocery ordering and fulfillment

↕  

[AI Services (CrewAI Agents + Mem0 Memory Layer)] + [Voice Services (Voxtral STT + TTS Provider TBD)] + [Third-party APIs (Instacart Developer Platform API)]  

5.3 Data Model  
Core Entities:  
- User (authentication, preferences)  
- Household (shared space, member permissions)  
- PantryItem (product, quantity, expiration, location)  
- Recipe (instructions, ingredients, nutrition)  
- ShoppingList (collaborative lists, status tracking)  
- Orders: id, user_id, instacart_order_id, status, created_at (for tracking Instacart orders)  

5.4 Multi-Agent System Design (Cutting-Edge 2025 Implementation)  
Framework: CrewAI (top open-source framework in 2025 for multi-agent collaboration, enabling agents to plan, act, and learn autonomously with reinforcement learning integration). Agents use hierarchical coordination for task decomposition, bi-directional communication for real-time adaptation, and human-in-the-loop oversight for critical decisions.  

Key Agents and Roles:  
- Orchestrator Agent: Central coordinator; routes user queries, manages task decomposition, resolves conflicts using reinforcement learning for optimization. Powered by GPT-4.1 for complex reasoning.  
- Pantry Agent: Tracks inventory, sets expirations, sends warnings; queries database and uses Mem0 for user-specific recall (e.g., preferred categories). Routed to GPT-4.1-mini for simple updates.  
- Meal Agent: Analyzes pantry data, user preferences via Mem0; generates recipe suggestions, filters diets using vector-aware embeddings for similarity matching. Uses GPT-4.1 for strategic reasoning in suggestions.  
- Shopping Agent: Builds lists from meal gaps; integrates Instacart API for orders, applies budget constraints. Routed to GPT-4.1-mini for list generation, GPT-4.1 for negotiation-like pricing checks.  
- Voice Agent: Processes speech inputs via Voxtral; converts to text, handles noise with edge computing for low-latency; triggers TTS responses. Uses GPT-4.1-mini for parsing.  
- Collaboration Agent: Syncs household data in real-time via WebSockets; manages permissions, edits with conflict resolution algorithms. Routed to GPT-4.1-mini.  

Interactions and Workflows:  
- User query (e.g., "Dinner ideas?") → Voice Agent parses → Orchestrator delegates to Pantry/Meal Agents in parallel → Meal Agent collaborates with Shopping Agent for missing items → Results synced via Collaboration Agent → TTS response.  
- Hierarchical Flow: Orchestrator breaks tasks into subtasks; agents execute sequentially or bi-directionally (e.g., Meal Agent queries Pantry Agent back for updates).  
- Adaptation: Agents learn from interactions via Mem0's multi-level memory (short-term session, long-term user prefs); reinforcement learning optimizes routing.  
- Challenges Mitigation: Agent malfunctions handled by error boundaries in CrewAI; coordination complexity via predefined protocols; scalability with GCP auto-scaling; security through encrypted inter-agent communication.  

6. User Experience Design  
6.1 Design Principles  
Voice-First: Every action should be completable via voice command, with natural TTS responses for a conversational experience  
Family-Friendly: Intuitive for all ages and tech comfort levels  
Contextual Intelligence: Reduce cognitive load through smart defaults, enhanced by Mem0 for personalized recall  
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design  

6.2 Key User Flows  
Flow 1: Adding Pantry Items  
User opens app or says "Hey Bruno"  
User says "I bought groceries" or taps add button  
Bruno verbally asks "What did you get?" (via TTS)  
User lists items: "Milk, bread, and chicken"  
Bruno verbally confirms items and suggests expiration dates (via TTS)  
Items added to shared household pantry  

Flow 2: Getting Meal Suggestions  
User asks "What can I make for dinner?"  
Bruno's Meal Agent analyzes pantry contents (via Pantry Agent) and preferences (recalled via Mem0)  
Bruno verbally suggests 3 recipes with available ingredients (via TTS)  
User selects preferred option  
Bruno provides step-by-step cooking guidance verbally (via TTS)  

Flow 3: Grocery Ordering via Instacart  
From meal suggestion, user selects "Order missing ingredients"  
Shopping Agent generates list and integrates with Instacart API  
User reviews and confirms order in-app  
Order placed via Instacart for delivery, with affiliate tracking
