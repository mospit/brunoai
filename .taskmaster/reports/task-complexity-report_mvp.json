		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Smart Pantry Tracking System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking down input method integrations (voice, text, barcode) into separate subtasks for add, edit, and delete flows; create distinct subtasks for data modeling, expiration logic, search/filter UX, and cross-method validation. Include subtasks for accessibility, error handling, and analytics instrumentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multi-modal input (voice, text, barcode), complex data modeling, expiration logic, and robust search/filter features. Each input method requires separate handling and validation, and expiration management adds time-based logic. Industry best practices recommend modularizing by input method and feature, and ensuring accessibility and analytics. The current 7 subtasks cover core flows, but further decomposition is needed for maintainability and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Voice Assistant Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by creating subtasks for accent/language model tuning, fallback UX design, error analytics, privacy/compliance review, and device compatibility testing. Separate STT and TTS integration into platform-specific subtasks, and add subtasks for continuous model evaluation and user feedback loops.",
			"reasoning": "Voice assistant integration is highly complex due to real-time STT/TTS, noise cancellation, multi-accent support, and fallback logic. Each component (STT, TTS, UX, noise handling) has platform-specific and cross-cutting concerns. Best practices call for granular subtasks for model tuning, error handling, analytics, and compliance, as well as continuous evaluation. The current 8 subtasks are comprehensive but can be further split for platform and compliance coverage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Household Sharing and Collaboration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for invitation UX, security/audit logging, API rate limiting, offline sync/reconciliation, detailed permission matrix, and user onboarding flows. Separate real-time sync and conflict resolution into client/server subtasks, and include subtasks for cross-device testing and GDPR/privacy compliance.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires secure multi-user collaboration, real-time sync, conflict resolution, and granular permissions—each with significant edge cases and security implications. Industry standards recommend decomposing for security, auditability, offline support, and compliance. The current 8 subtasks cover main flows but lack explicit coverage for security, onboarding, and compliance, which are critical for collaborative systems."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Basic Meal Suggestions Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for recipe data ingestion, GPT prompt engineering, user feedback collection, personalization logic, and API rate limiting. Separate dietary filter logic, missing ingredient UX, and favorites management into backend and frontend subtasks. Include subtasks for analytics and A/B testing.",
			"reasoning": "AI-powered meal suggestion involves NLP, dietary logic, user personalization, and integration with external APIs. Each feature (ingredient matching, dietary filters, favorites) has both backend and frontend aspects. Best practices suggest separating data ingestion, prompt engineering, and analytics. The current 6 subtasks are functional but can be expanded for maintainability and feature completeness."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Multi-Agent System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by creating subtasks for agent protocol definition, agent health monitoring, security/sandboxing, agent upgrade/versioning, inter-agent error handling, and simulation/testing environments. Separate each agent’s development and testing, and add subtasks for documentation and developer tooling.",
			"reasoning": "Multi-agent systems with CrewAI, RouteLLM, and Mem0 require advanced orchestration, inter-agent communication, security, and extensibility. Each agent is a subsystem with its own logic and dependencies. Industry standards recommend explicit subtasks for protocols, monitoring, security, and simulation. The current 7 subtasks are high-level; further decomposition is needed for robust, scalable implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Mobile App Frontend Development",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for device/browser compatibility, localization/internationalization, onboarding/tutorial flows, accessibility audits, performance profiling, and error reporting. Separate each main screen into design, implementation, and testing subtasks. Include subtasks for user analytics and crash reporting.",
			"reasoning": "A cross-platform Flutter app with voice, accessibility, and contextual intelligence is highly complex. Each screen and feature (pantry, meals, collaboration, voice) requires design, implementation, and testing. Best practices call for subtasks covering compatibility, localization, onboarding, analytics, and accessibility. The current 8 subtasks are broad; further breakdown improves maintainability and coverage."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Instacart Shopping Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for API error simulation, user consent/privacy handling, affiliate compliance review, store/region mapping, and UI/UX for order tracking. Separate backend and frontend integration for each flow, and include subtasks for analytics and reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Instacart integration involves third-party APIs, affiliate tracking, order status, and checkout UX. Each flow (order, tracking, affiliate) has backend and frontend aspects. Industry standards recommend explicit subtasks for error handling, compliance, and analytics. The current 6 subtasks are functional but can be expanded for robustness and compliance."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Testing and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for test data management, CI/CD pipeline integration, security testing, regression testing, exploratory/manual testing, and test documentation. Separate accessibility, performance, and voice testing into platform-specific subtasks. Include subtasks for test coverage reporting and defect triage.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive QA requires multiple test types (unit, integration, performance, accessibility, voice, memory, multi-agent) and coverage across platforms. Best practices call for subtasks for data management, CI/CD, security, regression, and documentation. The current 8 subtasks are broad; further decomposition ensures thorough coverage and traceability."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deployment and Launch Preparation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for app store review response, legal/privacy policy review, customer support training, incident response planning, rollback/rollback testing, and post-launch monitoring. Separate analytics, marketing, and support setup into granular subtasks. Include subtasks for localization and phased rollout management.",
			"reasoning": "Deployment and launch involve technical, operational, legal, and marketing activities. Each area (app store, analytics, support, marketing) has multiple steps and compliance requirements. Best practices recommend subtasks for review response, legal, support, incident handling, and phased rollout. The current 9 subtasks are comprehensive but can be expanded for operational readiness and risk mitigation."
