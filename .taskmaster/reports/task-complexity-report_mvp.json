		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Foundation and Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project foundation and setup into subtasks for initializing the Flutter project, setting up the FastAPI backend, configuring PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy, implementing user authentication, establishing GCP Cloud SQL, Storage, and Functions, and verifying initial connectivity and compilation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technology stacks (Flutter, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, GCP) and foundational infrastructure setup, each with its own configuration and integration challenges. Industry best practices recommend modularizing such foundational work to reduce risk and ensure maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Smart Pantry Tracking System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the smart pantry tracking system into subtasks for data model design, CRUD operations for each input method (voice, text, barcode), expiration management logic, warning notification system, and search/filter implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integrating multiple input modalities, managing complex state (expiration, warnings), and ensuring robust search/filtering. Each input method and feature introduces branching logic and increases cyclomatic complexity, warranting granular subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Voice Assistant Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose voice assistant integration into subtasks for STT integration, TTS provider setup, accent and language support, noise cancellation, fallback mechanisms, and end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating high-accuracy STT/TTS, supporting accents, and handling noisy environments are non-trivial and require specialized handling and testing. Each aspect should be isolated for focused development and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Household Sharing and Collaboration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down household sharing into subtasks for invitation system, real-time sync with WebSockets, conflict resolution logic, role-based permissions, multi-user testing, and security validation.",
			"reasoning": "Real-time collaboration, conflict resolution, and permissions introduce significant complexity and concurrency challenges. Industry standards recommend isolating these concerns to ensure robust, scalable, and secure implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Basic Meal Suggestions Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the meal suggestion engine into subtasks for ingredient analysis, recipe matching with GPT, dietary filter implementation, missing ingredient detection, and favorites management.",
			"reasoning": "While leveraging GPT models simplifies some logic, integrating user preferences, filtering, and state management for favorites still requires careful modularization for maintainability and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Multi-Agent System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose multi-agent system implementation into subtasks for CrewAI framework setup, individual agent development (Orchestrator, Pantry, Meal, Shopping, Voice, Collaboration), RouteLLM integration, Mem0 memory layer, and agent communication testing.",
			"reasoning": "Multi-agent architectures are inherently complex due to coordination, communication, and state persistence requirements. Each agent and supporting infrastructure (routing, memory) should be developed and validated independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Mobile App Frontend Development",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down mobile app frontend into subtasks for UI/UX design, Flutter screen development (pantry, meals, collaboration, voice), accessibility compliance, contextual intelligence integration, voice/touch interaction, and cross-platform testing.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a cross-platform, accessible, and context-aware UI with both voice and traditional interactions is complex and requires specialized subtasks for each major feature and compliance requirement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Instacart Shopping Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand Instacart integration into subtasks for API integration, affiliate tracking, order status management, store selection, checkout flow, and end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "Third-party API integration, affiliate logic, and seamless checkout require careful separation to handle external dependencies, error handling, and user experience flows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Testing and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose testing and QA into subtasks for unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, accessibility testing, voice/STT/TTS testing, memory/agent testing, beta testing, and metrics reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive QA across multiple domains (unit, integration, performance, accessibility, voice, memory, multi-agent) is highly complex and must be modularized to ensure coverage and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deployment and Launch Preparation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down deployment and launch into subtasks for production optimization, app store submission (iOS/Android), analytics setup, monitoring, customer support setup, and phased launch execution (beta, soft, full).",
			"reasoning": "Preparing for launch involves technical, operational, and business workflows, each with distinct requirements and dependencies. Industry best practices recommend treating each as a separate subtask for risk mitigation and traceability."
