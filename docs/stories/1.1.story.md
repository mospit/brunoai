### Story

As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account using my email and password, and then log in to the application, so that I can access its features.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new user can register with a unique email, a password, and their name.
2.  The system prevents registration with an email address that is already in use.
3.  A registered user can log in using their email and password.
4.  The system returns an error for invalid login credentials.
5.  Upon successful login, the user is issued a secure token (JWT) for authenticating subsequent API requests.

### Dev Notes

This story is the foundation for all user-specific functionality. It involves both frontend and backend work.

**Backend (FastAPI):**

*   **API Endpoints:** Implement the `/users/register` and `/users/login` endpoints as defined in `docs/architecture.md#5-api-specification`.
*   **Authentication:** Use Firebase Authentication for the core user management. When a user registers, create a user in Firebase first, then create a corresponding user in our PostgreSQL database. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#2-high-level-architecture`]
*   **Database:** Implement the `users` and `households` tables as per the schema in `docs/architecture.md#6-database-schema`. The `household_id` for a new user should be `NULL` initially.
*   **Security:** Upon successful login, generate a JWT signed with the `SECRET_KEY` from the environment variables. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#12-security-and-performance`]

**Frontend (Flutter):**

*   **Screens:** Build the `SplashScreen`, `LoginScreen`, and `RegistrationScreen` as detailed in `docs/architecture.md#7-frontend-component-plan`.
*   **State Management:** Use the BLoC pattern to manage the state for the authentication forms (e.g., loading state, error messages).
*   **API Client:** Create a service that communicates with the backend API endpoints. This service should handle storing the received JWT securely using the `flutter_secure_storage` package. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#12-security-and-performance`]
*   **Navigation:** After a successful registration or login, the user should be navigated to the `HouseholdPromptScreen`.

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Backend: Database Setup**
    *   [x] Create a new Alembic migration to add the `users` and `households` tables to the database based on the schema in `docs/architecture.md#6-database-schema`.
    *   [x] Apply the migration to the local development database.
2.  **Backend: User Registration**
    *   [x] Implement the `/users/register` endpoint.
    *   [x] Add logic to create a user in Firebase Authentication.
    *   [x] Add logic to create a corresponding user in the `users` table in PostgreSQL.
    *   [x] Write unit tests for the registration logic.
3.  **Backend: User Login**
    *   [x] Implement the `/users/login` endpoint.
    *   [x] Add logic to verify credentials against Firebase Authentication.
    *   [x] Add logic to generate and return a JWT upon successful authentication.
    *   [x] Write unit tests for the login logic.
4.  **Frontend: Screen Implementation**
    *   [x] Create the `LoginScreen` with email and password fields.
    *   [x] Create the `RegistrationScreen` with name, email, and password fields.
    *   [x] Implement the `SplashScreen` to handle the initial auth check.
5.  **Frontend: State Management & API Integration**
    *   [x] Create an `AuthenticationBloc` to manage the state for login and registration.
    *   [x] Create an `AuthenticationRepository` to handle the API calls to the backend.
    *   [x] Integrate the BLoC and Repository with the UI screens.
    *   [x] Securely store the JWT on the device after login.
6.  **Testing**
    *   [ ] Write widget tests for the `LoginScreen` and `RegistrationScreen` to verify the UI components. (AC: 1, 3)
    *   [x] Write integration tests for the backend API endpoints. (AC: 2, 4, 5)

### QA Results

**Review Date**: 2025-07-26  
**QA Engineer**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Status**: **CONDITIONALLY APPROVED** ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### ‚úÖ **STRENGTHS IDENTIFIED**
- Comprehensive backend implementation with JWT (15min access, 7day refresh)
- Firebase integration with fallback handling
- Robust security foundation (bcrypt, CSRF, rate limiting)
- Excellent frontend widget test coverage for LoginScreen and RegistrationScreen
- Proper BLoC pattern implementation and navigation testing

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS**
1. **API Endpoint Path Mismatch**: Story specifies `/users/register` and `/users/login` but implementation uses `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`
2. **Missing Integration Tests**: Task 6 shows incomplete backend integration tests for AC 2, 4, 5
3. **Firebase Integration Inconsistency**: Registration creates Firebase users but login flow has potential gaps

#### üìã **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VERIFICATION**
- AC 1-5: All functional requirements ‚úÖ **PASS**
- Testing requirements: Frontend ‚úÖ **PASS**, Backend integration ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE**

#### üéØ **REQUIRED ACTIONS**
**HIGH PRIORITY**:
- [ ] Implement missing backend integration tests covering AC 2, 4, 5
- [ ] Resolve API endpoint path discrepancy (/users vs /auth)
- [ ] Add password strength validation on backend to match frontend

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
- [ ] Enhance error handling with more specific HTTP status codes
- [ ] Add request/response logging for debugging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for login attempts

#### üèÜ **RECOMMENDATION**
The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices and meets all acceptance criteria functionally. However, the missing integration tests and API path discrepancy prevent full approval. Address these items before marking complete.

### Dev Agent Record

**Story Implementation Progress - Session 2025-07-26**

**COMPLETED**: Fixed API endpoint path discrepancy (HIGH PRIORITY QA Issue #1)
- ‚úÖ **Problem**: Story specifies `/users/register` and `/users/login` but implementation used `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Updated `server/bruno_ai_server/routes/auth.py` router prefix from `/auth` to `/users`
- ‚úÖ **Impact**: Updated authentication middleware in `server/bruno_ai_server/middleware/auth_middleware.py` to reflect new paths:
  - Updated `public_paths` set to use `/users/*` instead of `/auth/*`
  - Updated `auth_paths` set for rate limiting to use `/users/*` instead of `/auth/*`
- ‚úÖ **Verification**: Endpoints now correctly match architecture specification in `docs/architecture.md#5-api-specification`

**COMPLETED**: Implemented missing backend integration tests (HIGH PRIORITY QA Issue #2)
- ‚úÖ **Problem**: Task 6 showed incomplete backend integration tests for AC 2, 4, 5
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Created comprehensive integration test suite in `server/tests/integration/test_auth_integration.py`
- ‚úÖ **Coverage**: 
  - AC 2: `test_register_duplicate_email_integration` - Tests system prevents duplicate email registration
  - AC 4: `test_login_invalid_credentials_integration` - Tests error handling for invalid credentials
  - AC 5: `test_login_jwt_token_integration` - Tests JWT token issuance and validation
  - Additional tests: Complete registration/login flow, password validation, token refresh
- ‚úÖ **Updated existing unit tests**: Fixed all `/auth` endpoint references to use `/users` endpoints

**CURRENT STATUS**: 
- API endpoint paths now correctly aligned with specification ‚úÖ
- Backend integration tests now comprehensive and complete ‚úÖ
- Backend password strength validation needed to match frontend (remaining priority)

**FILES MODIFIED**:
- `server/bruno_ai_server/routes/auth.py` - Changed router prefix to `/users`
- `server/bruno_ai_server/middleware/auth_middleware.py` - Updated path references
- `server/tests/integration/test_auth_integration.py` - **NEW**: Comprehensive integration tests
- `server/tests/test_auth.py` - Updated all unit tests to use `/users` endpoints

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Add password strength validation on backend to match frontend
2. Run full test suite to verify all changes
3. Consider addressing medium priority QA items
